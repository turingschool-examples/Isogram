# Isogram 

## Setup 

Run `npm install` to install dev dependencies. 
Once you've done that you'll need to run `npm tests` to run the test suite. 

## Directive 

An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word") is a logological term for a word or phrase without a repeating letter. It is also used by some to mean a word or phrase in which each letter appears the same number of times, not necessarily just once.
Basically it is a word without any repeating characters. Currently the code in
this repository has all tests passing. The problem is that the solution isn't 
very eleoquent. In short we can do better. Your job is to refactor the code 
inside of the `/scripts/Isogram.js` with a passing test suite.
